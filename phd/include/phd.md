# Stakeholder Needs and Requirements

## Litmus test
- Even if you did not build the software the stakeholder will still have this need!
- They are located in the [environment of operation for the system-of-interest\*](https://robinagandhi.github.io/swa/slides/lecture-1/systems-security-engineering.html#15)

# Fitness for Purpose
## Software is built for a purpose
- It will fail if either:  
1. Designer has inadequate understanding of the purpose  
1. Software is used for a purpose different than originally designed for  

## Inadequate understanding of the purpose leads to poor quality software

???
# When will a designer have inadequate understanding of the purpose?

1. Software is too complex, designer does not know for sure if software will fulfill it purpose
1. Customer does not clearly know the purpose or express it
1. Purpose becomes apparent later.
1. Deliberate attempt to make the software not fulfill its purpose

.footnote[

???
# Requirements Engineering
- Requirements Engineering (RE) lies at the heart of software development.
- RE is concerned with identifying the purpose of a software system, and the contexts in which it will be used.
- Hence, RE acts as the bridge between the real world needs of users, customers, and other constituencies affected by a software system, and the capabilities and opportunities afforded by software-intensive technologies.

# Stakeholder Requirements

## These requirements are about .red[relationships] in the application domain
- They are not about the software system or the shared interface with the software system
- They are effects in the application domain that the customer wants the machine to guarantee

# Stakeholders Requirements

## Expressed in two moods
- .red[Optative]: expresses a wish (R)   
Desired condition over the phenomena of the environment
- .red[Indicative]: expresses things existing in the problem world (D)   
Given properties of the environment

# Problem Frames

- The machine solves a problem in the application domain (part of the world)
- The machine and the application domain interact at an interface of shared phenomena (events, states)
- The requirement adds a constraint to the application domain’s intrinsic properties or behavior

# Problem Frame Example

- A PC user wants to analyze the messages in the   
mail client’s mailbox.
- The messages for each correspondent are concatenated  
in one file. The mailfiles are all in one directory
- The analysis report has a specified format, with   
detail lines in order by correspondent name
- The analysis report will also show statistics on volume, size   
and frequency of incoming messages, time taken to reply

# Abuse Frame

## Abuse argument
- The malicious machine specification (MS), satisfies the vulnerability conditions (v(D)), to achieve the anti-requirement (AR). MS &#x2192; v(D), AR

# Abuse Frame

## Malicious Machine (M/M)
- Can be assigned to an existing domain, or a domain that is introduced into the problem world in order to reflect that an attacker can utilize the existing domains or other tools (e.g., a virus) that are not originally in the problem world D.

## Vulnerability v(D)
- Conditions in the problem world that combined with the Malicious Machine specification, will satisfy the anti-requirements
- An instance of the problem world that gives rise to an opportunity for attacks

- No exploitable weaknesses (Assurance Requirements)  

## S &#x2192; D, R; even when D includes a malicious adversary (A) trying to implement (AR)

# Functional Security Requirements

## Security related functions in the specification (S)

## Security related constraints in the problem world (D)

# Assurance Security Requirements  

## Weaknesses avoided in security functions of the specification (S)

## Weaknesses avoided in in the problem world (D)

# Reflection

## What did we just do?
- Using problem frames we built a bridge from stakeholder requirements to system requirements by identifying the necessary causal chains in the problem world.
- Using abuse and security frames we identify the causal chains and security capabilities necessary to satisfy the security requirements

Introduce the major mis-actors and misuse cases, i.e., threats that are reasonably likely. Name should give a clear understanding of motivation

### Step 3
Investigate the potential relations between misuse cases and use cases, especially in terms of potential “includes”-relations. Many threats can realized by a system’s normal functionality. E.g. denial of service, covert channels, sql injection

Introduce new use cases with the purpose to detect or prevent misuse cases

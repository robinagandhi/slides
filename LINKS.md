_Prosecutors say that between 2013 and 2016, Ly exploited his ability to remotely access electronic devices used by Expedia execs to access documents and emails containing confidential information.  
They say Ly kept an Expedia laptop without the knowledge of his company and continued to access devices and email accounts used by senior company execs to trade. Prosecutors say Ly even made it appear that other Expedia employees were the ones using the devices._

_How the SVG files managed to bypass Facebook’s file whitelist is also unknown, but Facebook has been notified of the attack, and will hopefully soon block it entirely. Google has already removed the offending extensions from its Chrome Store._

_Kryptowire, the security firm that discovered the vulnerability, said the Adups software transmitted the full contents of text messages, contact lists, call logs, location information and other data to a Chinese server. The code comes preinstalled on phones and the surveillance is not disclosed to users, said Tom Karygiannis, a vice president of Kryptowire, which is based in Fairfax, Va. “Even if you wanted to, you wouldn’t have known about it,” he said._
_Security experts frequently discover vulnerabilities in consumer electronics, but this case is exceptional. It was not a bug. Rather, Adups intentionally designed the software to help a Chinese phone manufacturer monitor user behavior, according to a document that Adups provided to explain the problem to BLU executives. That version of the software was not intended for American phones, the company said._

The attack came from the hacking crew known as Cozy Bear that U.S. officials have linked to earlier attacks on the Democratic National Committee, the White House, State Department and Joint Chiefs of Staff.


_Cozy Bear's flurry of activity on the morning of Nov. 9 targeted think tanks, non-governmental-organizations and university researchers, said Adair. Most of those targeted had ties to the national security, defense, international affairs, public policy, and European and Asian studies realms, according to Adair and other experts at cybersecurity firms that track the Russian hackers._


_"Before 9 a.m., we started seeing it," said Adair. "What are they after? We can't say with certainty. But one of the goals is to gain early access to the people who will have influence over where things are going, and to increase their foothold in organizations that are already playing, or will continue to play, a role in what happens next."_

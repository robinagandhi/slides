# CWE Types
### Weakness Class: e.g. [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
- Abstract, independent of any specific language or technology

### Weakness Base: e.g. [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)
- Abstract, sufficient details to infer specific methods for detection and prevention

### Weakness Variant: e.g. [CWE-85](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/85.html)
- Detailed, limited to a specific language or technology.

### Weakness Category: e.g. [CWE-990](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/990.html)
- A set of other entries that share a common characteristic

# Exercise
## Map [CVE-2004-0492](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2004-0492) to CWEs
- Description:   
Heap-based buffer overflow in proxy_util.c for mod_proxy in Apache 1.3.25 to 1.3.31 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative Content-Length HTTP header field, which causes a large amount of data to be copied.

# CWE Prioritization
## Negative Technical Impacts of Weaknesses
- Read data  
- Modify data  
- Denial-of-Service: unreliable execution  
- Denial-of-Service: resource consumption  
- Execute unauthorized code or commands  
- Gain privileges / assume identity  
- Bypass protection mechanism  
- Hide activities  

## Top CWE lists
- [CWE/SANS Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html)
- Scoring mechanisms: [CWSS](https://cwe.mitre.org/cwss/index.html), [CWRAF](https://cwe.mitre.org/cwraf/index.html)

???
The technical impacts help focus on the set of weaknesses that contribute to the negative technical impact of relevance in a given context. This helps to filter and prioritize a set of weaknesses.

# Key Questions a Weakness
### What are the .blue[Software flaws] (omission, commission, operational) that lead to the weakness?

# Do CWEs answer them?
### CWE-119: Failure to Constrain Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
- The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.
- Certain languages allow direct addressing of memory locations and do not automatically ensure that these locations are valid for the memory buffer that is being referenced. This can cause read or write operations to be performed on memory locations that may be associated with other variables, data structures, or internal program data. As a result, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code, alter the intended control flow, read sensitive information, or cause the system to crash.

# Some take aways...
## Ask Johnny (or your software vendor):
### What CWEs do the vulnerabilities in your project typically map to? Have you taken any hands-on training for them?

--
### Have you looked at the [semantic templates](http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/rgandhi/st) by being developed at UNO?
### Here are some [example vulnerabilities](http://faculty.ist.unomaha.edu/rgandhi/st/CVEsamples.zip), why don’t you fill-up the semantic templates to study them?
